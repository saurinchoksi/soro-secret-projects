  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>With this time machine, I'll be able to go back into the past and stop myself from cutting my own hair.</p>
    <p>But then... I wouldn't NEED to make the time machine... soooo, I wouldn't have gone back in time... sooo I WOULD need a time-machine... so... whatever! Let's DO THE DAMN THING.</p>
