  <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>With this time machine, I'll be able to go back into the past and stop myself from cutting my own hair.</p>
    <p>But then... I wouldn't NEED to make the time machine... soooo, I wouldn't have gone back in time... sooo I WOULD need a time-machine... so... whatever! Let's DO THE DAMN THING.</p>
  <h2>Materials</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>One large refrigerator box (the base station)</li>
    <li>Two medium-sized plastic tubs (for temporal engines)</li>
    <li>Aluminum foil (to cover and style engines)</li>
    <li>Colored buttons and switches (for the control panel)</li>
    <li>LED lights and batteries (to light up the control panel)</li>
    <li>Wiring and electrical tape (to connect the LEDs)</li>
    <li>Metallic spray paint (for a futuristic finish)</li>
    <li>Permanent markers (for designing and detailing)</li>
    <li>A big fan (for rear propulsion... or just looks)</li>
    <li>Scissors, glue, duct tape</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Cut and arrange the refrigerator box to create the main structure of the time machine.</li>
    <li>Attach plastic tubs to the sides as temporal engines using duct tape.</li>
    <li>Cover the tubs with aluminum foil and accentuate with metallic spray paint.</li>
    <li>Create a control panel using cardboard, affixing buttons and switches.</li>
    <li>Install LED lights behind the control panel for functional lighting effects.</li>
    <li>Draw circuits with permanent markers and set up wiring for the LEDs.</li>
    <li>Use the fan as a rear propeller, decorating it to match the time machine.</li>
    <li>Ensure all connections are secure with electrical tape and check the wiring.</li>
    <li>Decorate the exterior with markers to add details such as time circuits.</li>
    <li>Perform a final inspection to ensure everything is operational and safe.</li>
  </ol>
