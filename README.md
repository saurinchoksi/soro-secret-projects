# Soro's Secret Projects

Welcome to Soro's Secret Projects, a website showcasing my creative + technical skills,inspired by my original kids pilot script, "Soro Boro - Maker Bhais." This project combines storytelling, creativity, and front-end development to build upon the world of Soro Boro.

## About the Script

"Soro Boro - Maker Bhais" is an animated series for kids 6-9. 
Imagine the 1980's sitcom, Perfect Strangers meets Dexter's Laboratory.

Logline: Bonding over their love of making things, Soro and Boro defeat the neighborhood big kid, build a jetpack, and become best friends.

The series follows Soro & Boro as they embark on adventures of friendship, imagination, and making stuff, aiming to encourage a love for creativity and play.
